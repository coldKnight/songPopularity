[Rammstein](https://www.rammstein.de/en/) is a popular German Rock Metal band. 
[Band Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rammstein)

The global appeal of many bands leads to a number of translation requests for their songs into other languages for the non-native speakers. Rammstein is one of such bands with huge appeal outside of Germany. Some of their songs have been translated into more than 30 languages due to their popular demands.

Two popular sites that I have used personally are [herzeleid.com](http://herzeleid.com/en/lyrics) and [lyricstranslate.com](http://lyricstranslate.com/en/rammstein-lyrics.html#)

In this Python code, I use BeautifulSoup to fetch the data about the number of translation requests from the *lyricstranslate* website and plot them using Seaborn.

I have used only the Album songs and ignored the singles from the list to make the graph easy to read.

Unsurprisingly, Du Hast, Ich Will, Rammstein and Engel remain the most popular songs followed closely by Mutter, Ohne Dich, Mein Herz Brennt, Amerika and Sonne.

If you have any more interesting visualization about the band, feel free to raise a request.
